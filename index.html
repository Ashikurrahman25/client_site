            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Crypto Mingles vision is to develop a site where creators could
              monetize their content free of advertisers.
              <br />
              brought this vision to life. The onset of 2021 brought forth that
              OnlyFans is banning nudity in their website where we want to take
              over of that part.
            </p>

            <h3>OnlyFans in news</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                OnlyFans ban on sexually explicit content will endanger lives,
                say US sex workers
              </li>
              <li>
                Activists say website’s change will threaten livelihoods and
                force those working remotely online into ‘riskier street-based
                sex work’
              </li>
              <li>
                ‘OnlyFans would not exist without sex workers,’ said Cathy
                Reisenwitz, who is in the top 4% of creators on the site in
                terms of subscribers.
              </li>
              <li>
                American sex workers say subscription website OnlyFans’ decision
                to ban “sexually explicit” content will threaten their
                livelihoods, drive more of the industry underground, and
                ultimately endanger lives.
              </li>
              <li>
                OnlyFans to ban adult material after pressure from payment
                processors
              </li>
              <li>
                “They are taking away our safe spaces,” said Jane, an activist
                and OnlyFans creator who asked to be identified only by her
                first name. “Nobody wants to protect us.”
              </li>
              <li>
                OnlyFans, a subscriber-only website that hosts a range of
                producers but is most well-known for adult content, has exploded
                in popularity over the past year as sex work – like many
                professions – moved online amid the pandemic.
              </li>
              <li>
                Activists say the banning of pornographic content will push more
                people into danger. “This change will put workers on the street
                who could otherwise afford rent, it will starve the children of
                sex workers who could otherwise afford to feed them, and it will
                force workers currently working remotely online into riskier
                street-based sex work,” said Mary Moody, an online sex worker
                and co-chair of the Adult Industry Laborers and Artists
                Association.
              </li>
              <li>
                OnlyFans has been preferred by online sex workers because of its
                low fees compared with many adult camera and other content
                sites, allowing them to take home 80% of their earnings. Many
                say it has given them financial freedom they have not found in
                other industries.
              </li>
              <li>
                The decision will be “disastrous” for sex workers who used the
                platform to make their own earnings and gain more control of the
                work process, said Heather Berg, assistant professor of women,
                gender and sexuality studies at Washington University in St
                Louis.
              </li>
              <li>
                “For people who made a living off studio porn previously, the
                move to OnlyFans has meant significantly more control over
                safety, partner choice and representation – particularly
                important for performers of color and trans people,” she said.
                “This decision will move control and profit back into producers’
                hands.”
              </li>
              <li>
                The platform said in a statement the changes are meant to comply
                with the requests of its “banking partners and payout
                providers”.
              </li>
